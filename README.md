## Hey, I'm Lev Koliadich

- I was first introduced to programming in C++, and to this day it's the language I know best
- My second language of choice is Python, it complements C++ and is awesome by itself
- Recently started digging into functional programming in Haskell, and so far loving the ergonomics
- If you are hiring, be sure to consider my candidacy and you are welcome to chat anytime
